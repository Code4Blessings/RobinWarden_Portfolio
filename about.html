               <p>First, let me start out by saying thank you for taking the time to view my portfolio. I am so excited to be a part of this amazing industry that is Web Development.</p>

                <p>
                    Web Design, computers, and technology have been a hobby of mine for over 10 years but it never really occurred to me that said hobby could become a successful career for me until a year and a half ago. When I started self-training with Udemy courses in Web Design and Development, I fell in love. Fast forward to August 2019, social media introduced me to the Lambda School Coding Bootcamp where I am now a student in Full Stack Web Development. Below you will find a breakdown of my skills thus far.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My journey, down this road, has not only taught me the use of these skills, but it has also shown me how quickly I can learn a new computer language. Do you have a vision for your company? Of course, you do. However, in order to bring that vision to life, I believe your company needs someone who is not only skilled but is friendly, teachable, creative, focused, hard-working, and most importantly, a team-player. If you are interested, please send me an email so we could discuss this further. I look forward to meeting and networking with each and every one of you. 
                </p>
