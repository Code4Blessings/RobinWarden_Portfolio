Robin Warden's Responsive Portfolio

Greetings Potential Employer:

My name is Robin Warden and I am a Full Stack Web Developer and Designer. My skills and tools include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Postman, Adobe Photoshop, WordPress, Git, and Heroku.  Below is a brief description of the three projects, I listed in my portfolio.

<strong>Robofriends App</strong>
This app was created with React.js and Redux. It filters out the robots, listed in the app, based on what is written in the search bar. Try it.

<strong>Face Recognition App</strong>
This is the project I am most proud of. The front-end was created with React. The backend server was done with Node.js and tested using Postman. It also includes a database made with PostgreSQL. Give it a try by registering any random name, email, and password. Once given access, post a URL of an image in the form and click “Detect.”  The app will detect the face in the image.

<strong>Pokedex Card Game</strong>
This game was also created with React. Every time page is refreshed, the app deals two sets of random Pokémon cards.  The deck with the highest total experience gets the winning hand.
