Robin Warden's Responsive Portfolio

Greetings Potential Employer:

My name is Robin Warden and I am a Full Stack Web Developer and Designer. My skills and tools include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Redux, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Postman, Adobe Photoshop, WordPress, Git, and Heroku.  Below is a brief description of the five projects, I listed in my portfolio.

<strong>Receipt Tracker App</strong>
In this project, I collaborated with Front-End and Back-end Engineers as a UI Developer.  I designed and coded the Marketing Site for the app.  HTML and Less were used to build the site.  The images were provided by Unsplash.com and Pexels.com

<strong>Farm Fresh App</strong>
This was another project I collaborated in, only this time, I was one of the Front-End React Engineers.  This front-end portion of the app was built using  React-Hooks, React-Router, Context API, and Formik for form validation. The app is used like an Instacart app, only in this case, shoppers can create an account and ordrer fruits and vegetables from a farmer of their choice. Farmers can also create an account and show their inventory.  This app is still a work in progress.

<strong>ToDo App</strong>
This is a project I created with React, CSS, and a useReducer hook.  The way this app works is you type the task in the input section and click "ADD."  The task then displays on a list.  More tasks can be added to the list.  As they are completed, the user can click on the task and this will put a strikethrough on task.  This crossed task can then be deleted from the screen using the "Clear Completed" button.  Images were provided by Unsplash.com.

<strong>Cat Facts App</strong>
This project I built using React, CSS, Redux and a Cat API.  The way it works is you click on the "Cat Fact" button and the app will give you a random fact about cats.  Images were provided by Unsplash.com.

<strong>Pokedex Card Game</strong>
This game was also created with React. Every time page is refreshed, the app deals two sets of random Pok√©mon cards.  The deck with the highest total experience gets the winning hand.
